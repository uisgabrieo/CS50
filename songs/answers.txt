If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

Based on the tempo of the song, whether the listener prefers faster or slower songs, this can say a lot about their aura.
The genre of the songs, based on the artists, is another important factor.
Danceability is another key factor, directly related to the rhythm of the song.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

The person's musical taste might have changed over the course of the year.
The best way to measure a listener's aura is by checking the listening history for at least 3 years, including the current one, and analyzing the trajectory.
